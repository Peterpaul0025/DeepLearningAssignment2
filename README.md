# DeepLearningAssignment2
This Python program builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The CNN includes two convolutional layers with ReLU activation and max-pooling for feature extraction, followed by dense layers for classification. The dataset is normalized and reshaped for better training performance. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function for five epochs. Finally, the model’s accuracy is evaluated on the test dataset, and a plot is generated to show training versus validation accuracy over time.
